# ModhyobittoAngular

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.0.1.

This codebase was prepared as a project to put together all the little aha moments encountered while working on Angular over the years. This is hardly "the best" way to setup an Angular codebase (in case there can be a "best" way for anything this subjective) and it doesn't claim to be so.

I have prepared a detailed guide on how to set up and navigate the codebase:

[Introduction to optimized Angular codebase setup](https://owrrpon.medium.com/introduction-to-optimized-angular-codebase-setup-d60552dcb59a)
[Part 1 — Angular Component and Routing Setup](https://owrrpon.medium.com/optimized-angular-component-and-routing-setup-f39d675ac3dc)
[Part 2 — Styling Framework Setup](https://owrrpon.medium.com/optimized-styling-framework-setup-for-angular-add6646b19d9)
[Part 3 — Including Angular Material](https://owrrpon.medium.com/optimized-angular-material-setup-21ea8ea2b8)
[Part 4 — Service/ API Integration](https://owrrpon.medium.com/optimized-service-api-integration-for-angular-476eac8dc5c9)


That being said, I keep updating this repo beyond what is mentioned in the above guide. 

The idea is to easily help others and me in easily bootstrapping a practical Angular application. Knowing a framework is one thing and structuring a codebase is quite another. There is no "one perfect" way of doing things. This is simply one that has helped me in developing application codebases that looked clean, were easy to manage and fun to develop.


## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
